    This is an example of a web portal that can be used to authenticate users for
    = link_to "Mconf's desktop chat client.", 'https://github.com/mconf/mconf-chat-desktop'
    The source code for this application can be found
    = link_to 'in this repository.', 'https://github.com/mconf/mconf-chat-auth-example'
  %p
    It receives a 'token' from the desktop client and ask the user to accept it. Once accepted,
    the user can then sign in using this token as a password. The fact that a token exists and is
    a password is transparent to the user, that will need only to accept/deny access to the
    application.
    Currently only a single token is stored, but a real implementation could store multiple
    tokens to allow access to multiple chat clients simultaneously.
